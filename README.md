# giphy-api

This project is for the Penn LPS coding boot camp.

It was designed as an exercise to familiarize students with API functions. 

The wesbite loads buttons from an array to the top of the page. Users can press those buttons to generate a series of 10 gifs that will be generated fron a giphy search query. These  will display in a static state on the page. On click, the gifs will animate, and on a subsequent click the gif animation will stop.  If another button from the top of the page is clicked, the gifs will be replaced with a new set of gifs from another giphy search query. 

Additionaly, users can use a an input form to add another button to the top of the page. The button pushes a new object to the array from which the buttons were intitally loaded, then reruns the function that loaded the buttons in the first place. The new button should function the same as the previous buttons. 

This project was created by me - Martin Sandeen.
